Every once in awhile, technology can fail us. When your router stops working, it can almost feel like a badly. Internet is our connection to the world, after all. However, router issues can be easily fixed. When your router stops working, the first step is restart your router to see if that fixes the issue. If not, you may need to try something else.

If restarting your router doesn’t work, you’ll want to configure your WiFi connection. This can be done simply by opening up a new browser window and pasting in the IP address: http://192.168.0.1/ If it doesn’t work, try checking your manual just in case! Though, through this address you’ll be able to configure your WiFi connection.

Once configured, you may need to log back into to your router once the internet is working again. If you haven’t had to log in since setting up your router and have forgotten the default router password, you may think all hope is lost. Fortunately, the internet is a splendid thing. Even though you’re locked out of your router WiFi, try using your data on your smartphone (or call a friend who can access this information for you!) and simply type into a new google search the model of your router and default password. The search query should look a little something like this: “router model + default password”.

Once you’re able to log back into your router, remember to change the password to something you can remember! If none of these steps worked to help you fix your router, you can always phone your internet service provider for more help.
