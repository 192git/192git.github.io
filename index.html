<h3>Address login and administration:</h3>
As these private addresses can be used in a network, two devices cannot access the address at the same time and if such thing happens the IP conflicts and both devices become unstable.

When you enter this address, you are directed to a page which requires username and password. In order to access the address you have to provide correct username and password. Before accessing the address make sure that your computer is connected to the network. Now enter the address 192.168.0.1. Now you will be directed to the username and password page.

You can get this username and password from the user manual. Find your username and password and insert it in the text box. You can also change it once you can access the page. After providing this administrative login information you can use the router admin screen after authentication. If you are provided with an error message then there are several reasons for it. Your system might not be connected to the network. And if it is connected then you have to perform troubleshoot to establish connection. Reboot your connection and disable the firewall. Firewall can be a reason that you are not allowed to access the address. After these steps you can access the address and if you still face problem in connection then you have to consider resetting your device to defaults. This will change your username and password to default and now you can easily access the router admin screen.
