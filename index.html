Gb Whatsapp - For most people who have multiple Sims, they may likely not want a single messenger application such as the original WhatsApp. This is a big challenge because the original app may not be able to serve a particular number of contacts from the various Sims, and most individuals wouldn’t even think of using one WhatsApp for the different contacts instead they rather get another phone to serve that purpose. In Essence, GbWhatsApp is an application for people who want two WhatsApp in one phone. They can download and install the application to enable them to do whatever they want on the same phone without the app displaying error or application exists in the process of installation. The app is configured in such a way to accommodate two or multiple WhatsApp on one device.
